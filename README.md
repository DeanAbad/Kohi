# Kohi
A website project made with Materialize framework and VanillaJS. https://deanabad.github.io/Kohi/

## About
This work showcases the capabilities of Materialize CSS for making the frontend of an application i.e.
it is simple but versatile, that you will be able to focus on just working instead of worrying that much
on how features or behaviors will be implemented in a project.

## Notes
### Functionality
- For now, majority of the buttons do not work as I haven't included links to them yet. They would either
redirect you to the same page or reload the entire website.
These are the sections which buttons are not linked yet:
  - Navigation Bar - will just redirect you to the top of the page after clicking one of its buttons.
  - Card - will do the same as the Navigation Bar section's.
  - The fixed link with a <i>brand-logo</i> class at the bottom will redirect you to the same website.
- There is no an <i>About</i> section in the webpages, and it will tend to cause confusion to the visitors.

### Goals
With that being said, the following should be applied:
- [ ] Provide links for the buttons.
- [ ] Add About section
- [ ] Make a whole new app which combines all the functions and components of Materialize CSS, i.e. it does
not only showcase the aforementioned, but provides a demo of <b>what it can do</b>. This whole new app would
be included in a webpage together with its link.

### Name
- It got its name from coffee, i.e. on how Japanese pronounce it as 'ko-hi' (<a title="Listen to it here" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=coffee+pronounciation+in+japanese">コーヒー</a>).
- Also, it is titled to coffee because I thought it was fitting considering that it is associated by a lot of
people in programming, and that <b>it is easy to pronounce and remember, and is simple-looking</b>.
